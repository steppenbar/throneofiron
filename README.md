For this application I tried a different approach. I wanted a slider for the user to select the password lenght. I got caught up with a few issues in making it work that I didn't get a change to add a function for picking each character preference but I added them all in the mix. 

The main function is the Generate function. it interacts with the Var complexity and the Var values to give us our password. all of our previously used passwords get saved below.

Third and last function is our copy pass function for our clipboard.
